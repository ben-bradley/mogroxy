Mogroxy is a NodeJS implementation of the famous Upside-Down-Ternet.  Thanks to the flexibility inherent to NodeJS, the whole app only takes up 1.7K and less than 50 lines of code long.

By default, Mogroxy loads on port 8080 and will blur images that pass through it.  Feel free to change any of that, a quick review of the code should make it clear where & how to make changes.

A known limitation is that it does not support HTTPS.  This will be researched & included in a later release.

Combining this with ettercap can produce some more interesting results, but I'll leave that to the reader to sort out.

To get this working:
 1 Install NodeJS and ImageMagick
 2 Start the proxy: $ node ./mogroxy.js
 3 Point a browser at the proxy
 4 Giggle
